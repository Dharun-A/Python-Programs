Given two strings, a and b , that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make a and b anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.

Input :

    test cases,t
    two strings a and b, for each test case

Output:

Desired O/p

Constraints :

string lengths<=10000

Note :

Anagram of a word is formed by rearranging the letters of the word.

For e.g. -> For the word RAM - MAR,ARM,AMR,RMA etc. are few anagrams.
